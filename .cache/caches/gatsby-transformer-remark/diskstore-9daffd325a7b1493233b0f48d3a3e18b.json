During this time the product and design team gathered user feedback via UserVoice, FullStory viewing sessions, and follow-up interviews with key stakeholders identified early in the design process. The amalgamation of these exercises led to several small features being added over the course of a few months,  as well as some bugs being caught before full public launch.

In some cases this can cause minor inconveniences, however due to the complexity and enormity of this project we found that there were several moments when we were designing fully detailed interfaces in Sketch where we had to return to the whiteboard for another round of sketching.
