The product mission was to simplify the process of getting connected to Australia’s internet infrastructure, with no surprises and flexible month by month options for contracting.</p>\n<h2>Design Treatment</h2>\n<p>As per the product mission, the design team and I consulted with business owners of Belong to help create a website that strove for simplicity and low-friction from a sign-up perspective. Costs, T&#x26;C’s, and any other ‘fine text’ detail that other ADSL competitors often hid were exposed in the spirit of transparency. This humanistic philosophy trickled down into the design language of Belong’s online presence; simple block colours and flat design elements, juxtaposed with real-life, human imagery to further the brand’s disposition as an internet provider who desired to cut through the industry stigma and care for the end-user.</p>"}
