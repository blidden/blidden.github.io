It’s a safe place; one where I can let my mind wander in whatever way it wills. I also love sharing the experience of reading with others. Getting excited about a book with a friend, sharing insights, theories, and reflections over a coffee or glass of wine; it is one of the great joys of my life.</p>\n<p>For many years Goodreads has been my reading companion app of choice. Despite a scattered few competitors in the market, it remains the primary online platform for book recommendations and social cataloging. The product is a mix of networking, book progressions, recommendation engines, and shelf sorting. The initial offering was launched in 2007 and became acquired by Amazon in 2013.</p>\n<p>Since its acquisition, the product has remained stagnant on several fronts. Core functionality hasn’t adapted with modern web and design standards, and the user experience (UX) is lacking in several key areas. Similarly, the user interface (UI) is outdated and aesthetically bound to yesteryears Web 2.0 design language. As essentially the ‘only choice’ for reading enthusiasts in the digital space it’s fair to be flabbergasted by i) the fact that a large user base is enduring an otherwise subpar experience, and ii) the reality that no one has come along to disrupt the market.</p>\n<p>As both a user of this service, and someone who was looking to add something to their design portfolio, I thought it’d be fun to look at Goodreads from a product design perspective and conduct an unsolicited, conceptual redesign of the iOS app. I’ve never designed a mobile app before, so I was excited at the prospect of giving it a shot.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I am in no way associated with Goodreads or Amazon. As mentioned, this is very much an unsolicited design attempt — one which is conceptual at heart and by no means an exhaustive, end to end product overhaul.</p>\n<h2>Mission</h2>\n<p>The mission was initially simple: I wanted to chat with a few friends who use Goodreads, gather some of their pain points (adding my own into the mix), and mock up 2 or 3 screens with a 2020 design mindset.</p>\n<p>It played out differently in actuality. My partner (who is an avid reader) runs a casual <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/laura_reads_/\">book-themed Instagram account</a>, and by proxy is connected with active reading communities from all around the world. It dawned on me that, via her tribe of reading friends, I had access to actual users — people who I’m sure were both on Goodreads and had something to say about it.</p>\n<p>I devised a simple UX survey and asked if she’d post it on her account. A few days later I had 50 responses from users who had graciously shared their reflections.</p>\n<p>With the backing of real user reflections and stories, and a product-design focus, the mission became:</p>\n<p>Conceptually redesign some of the core screens of Goodreads\nImplement UX-supported user feedback/stories whilst aligning the design language with modern standards\nProduce basic prototypes in the process</p>\n<!-- <div class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\">\n\n![Darkness](./new_home.png)\n\n</div> -->"}
