				<p>Accelo is a complex product. Boasting features such as a CRM, time tracking, bulk billing, project management, ticketing, and utilisation analysis, it presents the designer with a challenge when it comes time to curating pathways to specific screens and features throughout the product.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Having been redesigned in 2015, with minimal work being dedicated to it since, the navigation framework in Accelo had become one dimensional and limited by nature. The product had since grown and evolved, as our market and users had changed over time. Quantitative user insights suggested that users were confused as to what constituted both a top and left-hand side (LHS) navigation panel. Other insights spoke of illogical pairings - such as placing module-specific ‘Favorites’ away from their respective module group in the LHS navigation panel.</p>

<p>Compounding these factors was the upcoming work on Custom Lists (a feature not yet released, but monumental in how it will shape the product). This initiative, once live, will radically change the way users find and action objects (Companies, Contacts, Projects, Issues etc.) inside Accelo. The current navigation system wasn’t designed in a way that would allow it to adapt accordingly with these new product visions.</p>

<div class="gallery full-width" data-columns="2"><img src="/images/projects/accelo-navigation/old_nav_1.png" /><img src="/images/projects/accelo-navigation/old_nav_2.png
	" /></div>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<h5 id="design-a-new-navigational-structure-that-supports-custom-lists">Design a new navigational structure that supports Custom Lists</h5>
<p>The upcoming Custom Lists product feature will change the way users find and organise work in Accelo. Custom Lists’ core function is the ability to expose large collections of data and allow the user to refine, manipulate, and expose a curated list of objects through the use of advanced filters and custom columns.</p>

<p>Giving users access to these created Custom Lists via navigation was the main piece of justification for it’s eventual redesign. The product team wanted the nav to support a future where users would go about creating/customising their Custom List, then be position to access them in frictionless fashion. The new nav had to pave the way for this experience by amalgamating public and private Custom Lists, as well as ones that had been recently viewed and favourited (categorised by their respective module).</p>

<h5 id="improve-nps-with-increased-simplicity-and-a-user-centric-nav-framework">Improve NPS with increased simplicity and a user-centric nav framework</h5>
<p>Quantitative insights revealed that the modern day Accelo user was confused as to what function each nav (top and LHS) served. Other common inquiries were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Why is ‘Recently Viewed’ under the ‘Favorites’ menu item?</li>
  <li>What is the difference between ‘Filters’ and ‘Shared Filters’?</li>
  <li>Why does the nav not scale on my small resolution?</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, the original nav had been designed from the vantage point of how Accelo saw the world - versus a more user-centric approach, backed by UX findings, of how they actually engage with the product. UX efforts were due in order to articulate what users need from Accelo’s nav - and how they go about traversing it’s many screens.</p>

<h5 id="decrease-the-amount-of-clicks-to-see-recently-viewed-and-favourites">Decrease the amount of clicks to see ‘Recently Viewed’ and ‘Favourites’</h5>
<p>The placement of an object’s ‘Recently Viewed’ and ‘Favourites’ list in Accelo was an afterthought. The top nav housed a ‘Saved’ menu item which in turn housed a 4-way toggle where such items were located. Not only were these items positioned in a pop out menu that didn’t allow for scaling, but they were unnecessarily detached from a logical grouping with their respective module (each object in Accelo belongs to a parent module).</p>

<h5 id="articulate-the-difference-between-the-top-and-lhs-nav-offerings-in-a-way-that-users-can-visually-comprehend">Articulate the difference between the top and LHS nav offerings, in a way that users can visually comprehend</h5>
<p>The current navigation system offered a LHS panel which was a one-click experience to see all objects pertaining to a specific module. The top nav was simply a collection of drop-down menus that housed links to screens and module-specific areas which could logically be located in a LHS area, however the framework wasn’t built in a way that supports such a notion. For this reason there was a natural disconnect.</p>

<p>The aim of the new nav was to dedicate the LHS area to investigation and data gathering, in a module-centric flow. If the user needed to find a specific project, or retainer, the LHS nav panel would be the place they go. Similarly, for one-off functions - such as timesheets and scheduling pages, which aren’t naturally paired to a module type - the top nav would be suitable (once refactored).</p>

<h3 id="additional-opportunities">Additional Opportunities</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Visually refresh the Accelo identity with contemporary navigation patterns, aligning it with the Accelo brand in the process</li>
  <li>Increase the visibility and focus on the global search function (a currently fragmented experience)</li>
  <li>Limit the noise of the top nav and improve information architecture (IA)</li>
  <li>Align with long-term product strategy regarding the simplification of Accelo</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>
<p>After several UX workshops and calls with users, as well as some internal workshops with product owners and success, several concepts were explored. The desire for an enhanced LHS nav experience was prominent from the beginning - which was one of the first design ideas I explored.</p>

<div class="gallery full-width" data-columns="3"><img src="/images/projects/accelo-navigation/nav_sketch_1.jpg" /><img src="/images/projects/accelo-navigation/nav_sketch_2.jpg" /><img src="/images/projects/accelo-navigation/nav_sketch_3.jpg
	" /></div>

<p>Initial concepts explored a dynamic LHS panel of module groupings, which expanded on click. Module groups housed lists of individual objects and custom lists (of that module type). One concept went as far as to completely drop the top nav panel, taking it’s contents and offerings and placing it in a LHS-panel exclusively. The idea was bold, and was explored in depth, however user feedback (via early prototypes) gave the design team the impression that there were too many functions to house in a singular navigational panel.</p>

<div class="gallery full-width" data-columns="2"><img src="/images/projects/accelo-navigation/nav_idea_1.jpg" /><img src="/images/projects/accelo-navigation/nav_idea_2.jpg
	" /></div>

<p>A return to the original framework of a top and LHS nav, with renewed thinking, took place. The LHS nav evolved from a ‘one-click to see all objects of a module’ experience to one which organised lists and objects in logical groupings. It also brought focus to the global search function in a way that dynamically interacted with where the user was clicking an expanded LHS nav perspective.</p>

<div class="gallery full-width" data-columns="2"><img src="/images/projects/accelo-navigation/new_nav_1.jpg" /><img src="/images/projects/accelo-navigation/new_nav_2.jpg" /><img src="/images/projects/accelo-navigation/new_nav_3.jpg" /><img src="/images/projects/accelo-navigation/new_nav_4.jpg" /><img src="/images/projects/accelo-navigation/new_nav_5.jpg" /><img src="/images/projects/accelo-navigation/new_nav_6.jpg
	" /></div>

<h3 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h3>

<h5 id="redesigned-navigation-menus">Redesigned Navigation Menus</h5>
<p>The top navigation menu was designed in a way that helped users quickly move through work, such as creating objects or logging time, and provided instant-access to action-oriented features like timesheets and the task boards.</p>

<p>The left navigation menu was the most significant change from its previous design. Users could still expect to find direct access into Accelo’s modules in this area, but the design team made additional improvements to help users quickly access the information they care about the most.</p>

<h5 id="a-more-standardised-navigational-journey">A More Standardised Navigational Journey</h5>
<p>In both the top and LHS nav menus, the design team made very particular decisions about how related objects, screens, and modules are grouped together based on feedback they received from users. One of our top priorities was ensuring that Accelo is as intuitive and easy to use as possible. This newest change helps us achieve this.</p>

<p>Grouping and categorising related items together creates a simpler, more standardised navigational journey that will help users return to areas of significance faster and with fewer clicks! It’s also our way of teaching new Accelo users about the relationships between modules, objects, and screens, so that they come to understand why the product works the way that it does.</p>

<h5 id="user-specific-categorisation-within-larger-left-navigation-panels">User-Specific Categorisation Within Larger Left Navigation Panels</h5>
<p>In addition to the grouping and categorisation of modules and objects in the LHS nav, we introduced larger LHS expanded panels, offering more user-specific power over the objects and screens that we provide direct links to.</p>

<p>In the LHS panels, we are now offering anywhere from 20 to 40 direct links to objects and screens that are specific to each user. For example, instead of clicking through multiple layers to get to the specific projects the user managed, or the clients that they oversee, the user can now get to them directly from our primary navigation.</p>

<p>The most exciting part about the links inside of these panels is that each user has more power over what is listed there. We wanted to ensure that our users can get to the items that are important to them today, and in the future, by surfacing their ‘Recently Viewed’ lists and objects. Additionally, we wanted to ensure that our users have a way of categorising and easily returning to lists and objects that are always important to them, so we decided to surface ‘Favorites’ in the new LHS nav as well.</p>

<h5 id="improved-global-search">Improved Global Search</h5>
<p>The global search functionality was significantly improved so that the journey of searching for and locating items is effortless. We continued to support the keyboard shortcut feature (Alt. + Forwardslash for Chrome or Internet Explorer and Alt + Shift + Forward-slash for Firefox), which allows the user to quickly search within a specific module. Additionally, the global search field was filled in with the module title in view when an expanded panel on the LHS nav is opened (so that if the item you’re trying to navigate to is not featured in that panel, you have one less step to take to search for it).</p>

<p>We also expanded the functionality of the global search panel to include a longer list of results in the drop-down menu than previously offered. Now users can find the item they need faster and more efficiently. Module groupings were also brought into the fold, allowing for a higher degree of specificity during the search experience.</p>
